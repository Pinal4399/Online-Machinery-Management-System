<tr><td class="style17">Component Based Software Development means focusing on 
    building large system by integrating existing or newly created components for 
    the purpose of reusability. This increases flexibility and maintainability of 
    the system, reduce software design, development, testing and maintenance cost. 
    This also makes sure that, some code in system is written once only rather than 
    multiple times in single system and reused wherever required rather then 
    re-written.<br /><br />

<tr><td class="style17">When applications are created using well designed component 
    architectures, it assures that, impact of change of technology or requirement 
    remains minimum on system. Nowadays businesses have lot of applications which 
    run on intranet where user interface design changes quickly. With well designed 
    component based architecture, impact of UI changes will be minimal.<br />

<tr><td class="style17">In CBSD, the notion of building a system by writing code has 
    been replaced with building a system by assembling and integrating existing 
    software components. In contrast to traditional development, where system 
    integration is often the tail end of an implementation effort, component 
    integration is the centerpiece of the approach; thus, implementation has given 
    way to integration as the focus of system construction. Because of this, 
    integrability is a key consideration in the decision whether to acquire, reuse, 
    or build the components.<br />

<tr><td class="style17">At Param, we develop system using component based 
    architecture in Microsoft .NET platform to reduce development and maintenance 
    for our clients. We have significant experience in developing .NET reusable 
    components from scratch or customizing Microsoft Application Blocks. With the 
    growth of web services, components can provide necessary separation between 
    external service interfaces from internal implementation and can be used from 
    anywhere.</td></tr>
