<tr>By having Param perform calibration for your machines, you&#39;ll be providing your 
    company with the best measurement integrity and ensuring that the products you 
    make can be relied upon. Param, above all other calibration suppliers, invests 
    heavily in maintaining its own measurement capability at the height of what is 
    achievable, so if we say it is in spec, you can rest assured that it is. If we 
    say it&#39;s out of spec, you can believe that too, with the confidence that we will 
    restore it to its original performance characteristics before returning it to 
    you.

<tr><td class="style17">Calibration is the process of establishing the relationship 
    between a measuring device and the units of measure. This is done by comparing a 
    device or the output of an instrument to a standard having known measurement 
    characteristics. For example the length of a stick can be calibrated by 
    comparing it to a standard that has a known length. Once the relationship of the 
    stick to the standard is known the stick is calibrated and can be used to 
    measure the length of other things.<br />

<tr><td class="style17">For many operations the quality of the calibration needs to 
    be known and is quantified by an uncertainty estimate for the calibration. This 
    is so important for the scientific community and manufacturing operations that 
    it has been proposed that an evaluation of the measurement uncertainty was added 
    as part of the calibration process.<br />

<tr><td class="style17">Calibration is performed by proficient team members ensuring 
    reliability. Proficiency of the team is routinely upgraded through periodic 
    training keeping pace with the advancing technologies and ever changing need of 
    progressive industry.<br />
