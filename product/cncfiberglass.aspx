                                    fibrous glass or glass wool. A fiber is a particle that is at least three times 
                                    as long as it is wide. The main fiber-forming substance in fiberglass is glass.<br />

                                            characteristics when combined together to achieve superior properties. The main 
                                            components of composites are reinforcing agents and matrix. The fibers, 
                                            particulates and whiskers act as the reinforcement and provide most of the 
                                            stiffness &amp; strength. The matrix binds the reinforcement together. Other 
                                            substances such as fillers are used to reduce the cost and improve process
