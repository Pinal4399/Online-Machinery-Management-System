So once you are set up, don't be discouraged if you butcher a couple blocks of foam. You'll soon get use to the rhythm, and your cores will turn out nice and smooth.<br />

         <tr>   <td> The Param Technosystem Pvt. Ltd. foam cutter is a computer-controlled device used to cut any shape in expanded and extruded foams. The hot wire moves in the Y and X planes thanks to microstepper motors controlled by the PC. This allows for a great cutting quality and high cutting speeds.<br />

        <tr><td>The precise mechanisms and perfect electronic control 
    of motors movement enable the operator to cut any shape, as long as its 
    thickness corresponds with the thickness of the material. There is also the 
    option of designing and cutting a few different outlines of the same project 
    which results in very attractive 3D shapes. The TurnTable makes it possible to 
    cut e.g. spheres, Lathe is irreplacable in column cutting, further possibilities 
    come with the ShapeWire Tool.<br />
