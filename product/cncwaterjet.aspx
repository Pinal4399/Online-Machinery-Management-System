&#8226;  <i>Advantage Waterjet </i> 
        <br />
</td>
</tr>
<tr>

<td>
Waterjet machines can cut through materials considered "unmachinable" by conventional cutting methods. As such, waterjet cutting has significant advantages over competing cutting methods, such as routers, Hi-Def Plasma, laser cutting and EDM. Waterjet cutting can be an alternative to casting forged blanks.<br />

<td>
The advantages of abrasive waterjet cutting extend beyond its cost-competitiveness with other cutting techniques. Waterjet machines are capable of complex and difficult shapes, such as inside corners, notches, architectural and artistic shapes. Waterjet cutting is a CAD driven process, thus it also offers the capability of repeatability, not available with most other cutting methods. Waterjet can be used for cutting composites and plastics that cannot tolerate heat, mechanical damage or delamination.

<td>
The CNC controlled and narrow kerf (or cut) resulting from the waterjet cut allows for exceptionally efficient usage of expensive materials such as titanium, composites and optical glass. The narrow kerf also allows for optimum material yields due to tight nesting of the parts (tight tolerances / - .005" depending on the material). In addition the process provides mass production capability with exception repeatability. Parts can be re-manufactured by simply reentering previously run computer programs.

<tr><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Waterjet cutting is an environmentally friendly solution compared to many other complex cutting operations. Everything we use to cut our shapes is an all-natural product and cutting oils and aids are not needed with this process. The process is clean, does not create dust, by-products like grindings and chips, or chemical air pollution. The Waterjet stream carries away the eroded material, practically eliminating dust and does not generate pollutants and fumes associated with other cutting methods. Why waterjet cutting?
