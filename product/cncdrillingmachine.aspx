<tr> <td class="style3"> Plasma cutters work by sending an electric arc through a gas that is passing through a constricted opening.&nbsp;The gas can be 
                    shop air, nitrogen, argon, oxygen. etc.

                    the point that it enters a 4th state of matter.We all are familiar with the 
                    first three: i.e., solid, liquid, and gas. Scientists call this additional state 
                    plasma.As the metal being cut is part of thecircuit, the electrical 
                    conductivity of the plasma causes the arc to transfer to the work.

                                The restricted opening (nozzle) the gas passes through causes it to squeeze by 
                                at a high speed, like air passing through a venturi in a carburetor.This high 
                                speed gas cuts through the molten metal.The gas is also directed around the 
                                perimeter of the cutting area to shield the cut.

                                In many of today&#39;s better plasma cutters, a pilot arc between the electrode and 
                                nozzle is used to ionize the gas and initially generate the plasma prior to the 
                                arc transfer.

                                Other methods that have been used are touching the torch tip to the work to 
                                create a spark, and the use of a high-frequency starting circuit (like a spark 
                                plug). Neither of these latter two methods is compatible with CNC (automated) 
                                cutting.
