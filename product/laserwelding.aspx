                                       <p> The laser beam penetrates the upper &quot;transparent&quot; component and is converted 
                                            into heat by the absorbing lower component. Since both components need to be 
                                            pressed together (as in other methods), heat is conducted from the absorbing 
                                            lower component allowing both parts to melt and create a bond only where the 
                                            laser beam is directed. Clamping of the plastic components that are to be 
                                            assembled is still essential so that intimate contact is made to allow the laser 
                                            beam to melt exactly where the parts need to be bonded together.</p>
                                               
                                          <p>  Nearly all thermoplastics can be welded using the proper laser components. 
                                            Special additives /pigments also allow welding of dark to dark materials as well 
                                            as transparent to transparent combinations. It&#39;s all about color, specifically 
                                            what color the laser thinks your part is. Parts that appear very dark to the 
                                            human eye can be either transmissive or absorptive, depending on the formulation 
                                            of the pigment. Even joints that require.</p>
                                      
                                          <p>optical clarity (clear-to-clear) can be achieved. Laser welding of 
                                            thermoplastics depends on many of the same rules of resin compatibility that the 
                                            other processes do, but is more forgiving of resin chemistry or melt temperature 
                                            differences than most other plastic welding processes.</p>

                                            Diode Lasers operate at a specific wavelength. They are relatively compact, 
                                            light, and cost-effective. Our diode lasers are available in a wide range of 
                                            power levels at both 808 and 940 nanometer wavelengths.
                                       
                                           
                                            Direct Beam delivery use optics that are mounted directly on the laser housing 
                                            and fixed in focal length and beam position relative to the housing. They are 
                                            used primarily in systems using the moveable part concept or with diode lasers 
                                            mounted on robot arms.
                                      
                                            Fiber Delivery is used to get the beam into a tight spot where the laser housing 
                                            may not be able to go. It is useful for delivering a beam to a robot or for 
                                            fixed mounting in a small space within an automated machine.
